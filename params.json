  "tagline": "With this project, one can provide IN TIME alerts whenever someone steals an object that is meant to be stationary inside the room. This was inspired by a request the Director of E&T, SRM University to the IOT Alliance Club [iotalliance.in] of SRM University. It is funded by the same. Visit the club at iotalliance.in :)",
  "body": "# Anti-Theft-Device-For-CCTV-Cameras\r\n## Abstract\r\n<p>Internet of Things is all about connecting anything, anytime and anywhere. With the advent of the government taking up initiatives like Smart Cities, we as budding engineering students who are venturing into the new world, wanted to do a project that is in line with the current technology of the real world. We wanted to do a project that lets us give back something to the University that is providing our education and hence decided to do a project related to Smart Campus. Upon showing a proposal to the Director (E&amp;T), SRM University Kattankulathur, he discussed his concern regarding the safety of CCTV cameras inside the university campus and requested a project to be done regarding the same.</p>\r\n<p> Hence, we decided to take it up as our minor project, leading to an “Anti-theft device for CCTV cameras”. This project focuses on providing just in time alerts to the concerned authorities upon the theft of the CCTV cameras inside the campus.</p>\r\n<p>Two levels of security are used in this device.\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li> The first level is a wire that connects the CCTV Camera and the controller. If the wire is not cut, the connection is close and current passes through the port to which the CCTV Camera is connected, to the controller. If the wire is cut, the connection is open and the current does not pass through the port to which the CCTV camera is connected to the controller, this happens when the CCTV camera and the anti-theft device are physically separated from each.</li>\r\n    <li> The second level consists of two components, an IR Transmitter such as an IR LED, and an IR receiver circuit. The IR LED and the receiver as a combination can act as a proximity sensor. This combination is attached to the camera and as long as the camera and the wall are in close proximity, the camera is safe. When a person removes the camera, the wall and the camera are no longer in close proximity. This triggers the alerts.</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <br>In order to send the alerts, we are using a GSM module that is connected to the Arduino to send SMS and make calls.The Raspberry Pi connects to the Internet and sends email and posts status of the CCTV camera to the online portal. Multiple Arduinos can be connected to a single Pi to allow scalability for real world usage. All the cameras in a single floor can have a common Raspberry Pi module through which they connect to the Internet.\r\n</p>\r\n##Components\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Arduino Uno , can buy <a
